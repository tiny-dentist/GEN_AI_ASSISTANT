# Introduction
With the introduction of Transformer architecture from the research paper "Attention Is All You Need" from 2017, there has been a rapid advancement in the field of Natural Language Processing. We now have advanced state of the art models like GPT-4o, Claude 3 and Grok which have good reasoning capability and are capable of solving complex task without requiring human intervention, ensuring they become a force multiplier in our daily parts of life. With this, Il like to demonstrate my solution called Empower AI, a speech to speech pipleline consisting of an ASR Model to convert speech to text, an LLM to take in the converted speech to text as input for solving user query's and an TTS model to convert the text back to an audio response. This solution can have huge benefits for visually challenged people, who can easily interact with the solution with their voice alone instead of relying on braille script which is hard to maintain and expensive to produce.
